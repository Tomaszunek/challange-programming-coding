## Path of between all dest

This problem was asked by `Google`.

Given a list of integers `S` and a target number `k`, write a function that returns a subset of `S` that adds up to `k`. If such a subset cannot be made, then return `null`.

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.
