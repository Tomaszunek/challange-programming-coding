## Possible Queen arrangements of the board

This problem was asked by `Microsoft`.

You have an N by N board. Write a function that, given `N`, returns the number of possible arrangements of the board where `N` queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other, i.e. `no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal`.
Please no set more then 5 board size, that will be lagge;

```jsx
<Day38 :boardSize="3" />
```
