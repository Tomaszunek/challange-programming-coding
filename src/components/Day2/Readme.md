## Product of input array

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

For example, if our input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output would be `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. If our input was `[3, 2, 1]`, the expected output would be `[2, 3, 6]`.


You can modify the code through the playground

```jsx
<Day2 arrayItems="[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"/>
```

```jsx
<Day2 arrayItems="[3, 2, 1]"/>
```
