## Strings with prefixes

This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string `s` and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string `de` and the set of strings [`dog`, `deer`, `deal`], return [`deer`, `deal`].

```jsx
<Day12 :countN="4" :stairsCount1="1" :stairsCount2="2" />
```

```jsx
<Day12 :countN="15" :stairsCount1="6" :stairsCount2="3" />
```
