## Linked link intersecting node

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given `A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10` and `B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10`, return the node with value `8`.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

```jsx
<Day21 arrayProps="[[30, 75],[0, 50],[60, 150],[60, 150], [50, 160]]" />
```
