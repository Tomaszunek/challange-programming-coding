## Longest unique substring

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an integer `k` and a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most `k` distinct characters.

For example, given `s = "abcba"` and `k = 2`, the longest substring with `k` distinct characters is `"bcb"`.

```jsx
<Day13 stringProp="abcbd" :uniqueLettersCount="2" />
```
