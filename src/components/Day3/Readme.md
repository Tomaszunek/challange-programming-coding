## Two numbers add up to given number

Given the root to a binary tree, implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree.

For example, given the following `Node` class
`class Node: def **init**(self, val, left=None, right=None):`
`self.val = val`
`self.left = left`
`self.right = right`

You can modify the code through the playground

```jsx
<Day3 />
```
