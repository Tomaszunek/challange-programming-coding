## Count ways to decode number

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given the mapping `a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26`, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message `'111'` would give `3`, since it could be decoded as `'aaa'`, `'ka'`, and `'ak'`.

```jsx
<Day9 numbers="[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]" />
```

```jsx
<Day9 numbers="[5, 1, 1, 5]" />
```
